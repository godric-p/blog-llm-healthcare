Mental health counseling can provide the patient with strategies to manage anxiety, including cognitive-behavioral techniques and relaxation exercises. This approach can also help to identify any potential triggers or underlying issues that may be contributing to the anxiety. This recommendation is in line with best practice guidelines for the management of anxiety disorders in older adults."

Lab tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, and tests for inflammation markers, can help in diagnosing the condition accurately. Additionally, stool tests may be required to rule out infections or other conditions.
